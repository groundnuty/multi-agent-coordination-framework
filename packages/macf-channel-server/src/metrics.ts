/**
 * Shared meter + metric instrument conventions for MACF channel server.
 *
 * Single source of truth for instrument names + attribute keys (parallels
 * `tracing.ts` for spans). Counter increments scattered across `https.ts`
 * (server-side `/notify` handler) and `notify-peer.ts` (client-side
 * outbound) read from this module so the canonical names + label sets
 * stay synchronized.
 *
 * Closes testbed#242 T6 (deferred metrics AC) per macf#278:
 *   - `macf.notify_received_total{type, agent}` — server-side counter,
 *     incremented per inbound /notify request after schema validation
 *   - `macf.notify_peer_total{event, delivered, agent}` — client-side
 *     counter, incremented per notify_peer broadcast (one increment per
 *     attempted peer; `delivered` label distinguishes success / failure)
 *
 * Both counters fire only when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set;
 * `getMeter()` returns a no-op meter (zero-cost) when unset, mirroring
 * `getTracer()`'s pattern in `tracing.ts`. See DR-021 for the
 * zero-cost-default doctrine.
 *
 * Naming convention: `macf.<area>.<metric>_<unit>` per OTel semantic
 * conventions guidance. Counters end in `_total`; histograms (none yet)
 * would end in their unit (e.g., `_duration_ms`).
