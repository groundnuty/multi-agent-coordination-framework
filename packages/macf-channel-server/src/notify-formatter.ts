 * Render a NotifyPayload to the operator-facing content string that
 * gets pushed through MCP. Pure function — extracted from `onNotify`
 * in `server.ts` per ultrareview finding A6. Previously the renderer
 * lived inside a 58-line closure that also did logging, health-state
 * mutation, and MCP push; adding a new `NotifyPayload` variant meant
 * editing that closure. Extracting makes variant dispatch testable
 * in isolation.
 *
 * Returns the rendered content and the issue number the payload is
 * associated with (for health-state updates at the call site).
