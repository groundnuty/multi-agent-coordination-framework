 * Barrel export for the macf-core package.

 * Internal-shared-code package consumed by the MACF CLI and channel-
 * server packages via npm workspaces. Not intended for direct
 * external use (will be marked deprecated-internal on first npm
 * publish per DR-022 Amendment A).
 *
 * Re-exports everything the consumers need so they can
 * `import { X } from 'macf-core'` instead of reaching into
 * subpaths. Subpath imports are still supported via the `exports`
 * map in package.json for consumers that need a specific module.
