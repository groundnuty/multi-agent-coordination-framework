# P6: Action Update — Reusable Workflow + Versioned Distribution

**Goal:** Extract the routing Action into a centrally-maintained, versioned reusable workflow. Swap SSH+tmux delivery for mTLS HTTP POST. Establish versioned distribution as the single source of truth for MACF infra.

**Depends on:** P1 (channel endpoint), P2 (registry discovery), P3 (mTLS certs), P4 (CLI)
**Design decisions:** DR-003, DR-005, DR-006, DR-017

## Scope Change (2026-04-15)

**Original scope:** Swap SSH+tmux → mTLS POST inside the existing per-repo Action YAML.

**Expanded scope:** Extract the Action to a central `groundnuty/macf-actions` repo as a **versioned reusable workflow**. Consumers reference it via `uses: groundnuty/macf-actions/.github/workflows/agent-router.yml@v1` instead of copying 150 lines of YAML. Add CLI commands to bootstrap repos with version pins.

**Why:** Single source of truth. When we swap SSH→mTLS or add a feature, consumers bump `@v1` → `@v2` instead of copy-paste-merge-conflict across N repos.

## Deliverables

### 1. `groundnuty/macf-actions` repo (new)

```
macf-actions/
  .github/
    workflows/
      agent-router.yml          ← reusable workflow (callable)
  actions/
    (optional composite actions if we extract parts)
  README.md                      ← versioning policy, usage
  CHANGELOG.md                   ← semver changelog
```

Initial release: `v1.0.0` + floating `v1.0` + floating `v1` — matches current `agent-router.yml` on `groundnuty/macf` (SSH+tmux). This locks in the current behavior as `v1.x` so consumers can migrate without breaking changes.

Future release: `v2.0.0` + `v2.0` + `v2` — mTLS HTTP POST variant (the original P6 functionality).

### 2. Versioning scheme

Floating major tags + immutable semver tags (standard GitHub Actions convention):

| Tag | Moves? | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `v1.0.0` | Immutable | Production (max stability) |
| `v1.0` | Floats to latest `v1.0.x` | Production (patches only) |
| `v1` | Floats to latest `v1.x.x` | Typical (auto-update within major) |

Breaking changes = new major (`v2`). Older majors remain live with backported patches.

### 3. Consumer workflow (5 lines instead of 150)

```yaml
# academic-resume/.github/workflows/agent-router.yml
name: Agent Router
on:
  issues: { types: [labeled, closed] }
  issue_comment: { types: [created] }
  pull_request: { types: [opened] }
  pull_request_review: { types: [submitted] }
jobs:
  route:
    uses: groundnuty/macf-actions/.github/workflows/agent-router.yml@v1
    secrets: inherit
```

### 4. Per-repo config stays local

`.github/agent-config.json` stays in the consumer repo (it's per-repo specific — agent names, hosts, sessions). The reusable workflow reads it from the calling repo via `actions/checkout`.

### 5. CLI additions (extends P4)

- **`macf repo-init`** — generates `.github/workflows/agent-router.yml` caller + `.github/agent-config.json` + creates labels + prompts for repo secrets
- **`macf init`** — writes version pins to `macf-agent.json` (new `versions` section)
- **`macf update`** — interactive version bump for pinned components

### 6. Version pinning in `macf-agent.json`

```json
{
  "project": "macf",
  "agent_name": "code-agent",
  "versions": {
    "cli": "0.1.0",
    "plugin": "0.1.0",
    "actions": "v1"
  },
  ...
}
```

`macf update` reads available versions (npm for CLI, GitHub Releases for plugin/actions) and prompts which to bump.

The reusable workflow is **callable across repositories**. Consumers reference it by Git ref (`@v1`). GitHub downloads the workflow definition at run time.

## What Changes (Original Scope Retained)

| Component | Before (SSH) | After v2 (mTLS) |
|---|---|---|
| Network setup | Tailscale + SSH key | Tailscale + mTLS cert |
| Agent discovery | Read `agent-config.json` | Read `{PROJECT}_AGENT_*` from registry |
| Message delivery | `ssh ... tmux send-keys` | `curl --cert ... POST /notify` |
| Offline detection | SSH failure | HTTP POST timeout |
| Secrets needed | SSH key, TS OAuth | Router cert+key, TS OAuth, CA cert |

---

## Action Secrets/Variables for v2 (mTLS)

| Name | Type | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | Secret | Tailscale | VPN access |
| `TS_OAUTH_SECRET` | Secret | Tailscale | VPN access |
| `MACF_ROUTER_CERT` | Secret | P3 cert generation | mTLS client cert |
| `MACF_ROUTER_KEY` | Secret | P3 cert generation | mTLS client key |
| `{PROJECT}_CA_CERT` | Variable | P3 CA init | mTLS CA verification |
| `PROJECT_TOKEN` | Secret | GitHub PAT | Board sync (if Projects used) |

---

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase A (v1 extraction)**: `macf-actions` is created, `v1` matches current SSH+tmux behavior exactly. `groundnuty/academic-resume` migrates to the 5-line caller form, references `@v1`. This is the testing ground — validates the reusable workflow mechanism works.
2. **Phase B (CLI additions)**: `macf repo-init` command generates the 5-line caller. `macf init` writes version pins. `macf update` bumps them.
3. **Phase C (v2 mTLS variant)**: Build the mTLS POST variant as `v2`. Requires consumers have mTLS certs provisioned (P3). Consumers opt-in by bumping `@v1` → `@v2`.
4. **Phase D (defer)**: Migrate `groundnuty/macf` itself to the reusable workflow. Deferred — don't want to break the macf routing while iterating on the testing ground.

## Tests

- v1 reusable workflow: consumer workflow validates and runs on a test repo
- v1 behavior: label routing, mention routing, cleanup all work identically to current copy-pasted Action
- v2 behavior (when built): mTLS POST succeeds → no offline label; POST fails → offline label added
- Version pinning: `macf init` writes correct pins; `macf update` bumps correctly
- `macf repo-init`: generates valid 5-line caller, creates labels, prompts for secrets

---

## Out of Scope

- Migrating `groundnuty/macf` itself to the reusable workflow (Phase D, deferred)
- Distributing composite actions separately (may emerge organically)
- Marketplace listing (may add later for discoverability)

## Implementation status (2026-04-27 — `macf#257` audit)

**Shipped in `groundnuty/macf-actions` v3.x.** `agent-router.yml` v3 is "registry-driven mTLS transport" per its own header — all three routing paths (`route-by-label`, `route-by-mention`, `route-by-ci-completion`) use the mTLS POST shape:

```bash
HTTP_CODE=$(curl --silent --show-error \
  --max-time 30 -X POST "https://${HOST}:${PORT}/notify" \
  ...)
if [ "$CURL_RC" -eq 0 ] && [ "$HTTP_CODE" = "200" ]; then
  echo "Routed issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER} to ${LABEL} via mTLS POST (HTTP 200)"
```

Pattern A result-invariant assertion (per `silent-fallback-hazards.md` Instance 3 defense): the HTTP 200 from the channel server is the receipt-acknowledgement check; the curl exit code alone is insufficient. SSH+tmux paths are gone from active code (only mentioned in legacy comments at line 42 noting v2.x fields are unread under v3).

Address resolution per DR-005/DR-006/DR-007: `HOST`/`PORT` come from `MACF_<PROJECT>_AGENT_<NAME>` registry variable populated by the channel server on launch.

**Remaining work for Stage 3 cutover (tracked in `macf#257`):**

- Fleet cutover: each substrate agent runs `macf init` to enable channel server (operator-coordinated; per-agent self-migration per `macf#257` Phase B path 2)
- Migration runbook: `design/stage2-to-stage3-migration.md` (Phase A deliverable)
- `silent-fallback-hazards.md` Instance 3 status update post-observation-window (handled in `groundnuty/macf-science-agent`)
