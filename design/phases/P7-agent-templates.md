# P7: Agent Templates

**Goal:** Complete agent identity definitions for all roles, encoding the tribal knowledge from the CPC project.

**Depends on:** P5 (plugin packaging, where agents are bundled)
**Design decisions:** DR-008, DR-009

---

## Deliverables

Seven agent definition files for the plugin's `agents/` directory. Each defines:
- Agent identity (who am I)
- Workflow (how I work)
- Issue lifecycle (turn-based protocol)
- Communication rules (@mentions, discussion in issues)
- Token refresh (embedded in command blocks)
- Label convention
- Role-specific behavior

## Agent Definitions

### Permanent Agents

#### `code-agent.md`
- Identity: implements features, fixes bugs
- Workflow: pull main → branch → implement → PR → ask for review → STOP → merge on LGTM → return to main
- Finishing Work: single chained command (token refresh + PR create + label update + review request comment)
- Merge: separate section, only on LGTM
- Key rules: @mention in every comment, never remove agent label, read full issue before starting

#### `science-agent.md`
- Identity: designs experiments, analyzes results, files issues, reviews PRs
- "Now or backlog?" prompt before filing issues
- Cross-repo `--repo` flags for all `gh` commands
- Findings pattern: write structured finding files (F1, F2...)
- Code access: use Explore subagent, not direct file reads
- Review: honest review — LGTM if good, request changes if not

#### `writing-agent.md`
- Identity: writes LaTeX, formats tables/figures, edits prose
- Works in paper repo
- Receives issues from science-agent with structural instructions
- Reviews focus on writing quality, not scientific accuracy
- Commits after every paper change

### Experiment Agents

#### `exp-code-agent.md`
- Same as code-agent but: no memory, no accumulated learning, fresh per run
- No self-chaining (doesn't check for more work after task)
- Experiment-specific: "Your only task is the issue that was routed to you"

#### `exp-science-code-aware.md`
- Science-agent variant with full code access
- Files issues with exact file paths and function names
- For Condition B1 of the experiment

#### `exp-science-domain-only.md`
- Science-agent variant with NO code access
- Files issues with domain-level descriptions only
- Cannot reference file paths, function names, or code structure
- For Condition B2 of the experiment
- Explicit rule: "You do not have access to the codebase. Describe what needs to be done, not how."

#### `exp-single-agent.md`
- Combined code + science role
- Does everything: reads task, implements, self-reviews, creates PR
- For Condition A (single-agent baseline)
- No coordination, no GitHub Issues for routing

### Worker Pool

Worker agents use the permanent agent templates but with `agent_type: worker` in config. The template is the same — the difference is lifecycle (disposable) and identity (shared `macf-worker[bot]` App, tagged comments).

## Key Patterns from CPC (Tribal Knowledge)

Encoded into all agent templates:

1. **Token refresh in command blocks** — not as a separate instruction (agents ignore separate instructions ~20% of the time)
2. **Turn-based workflow** — agent's turn ends after PR creation, merge only on routed LGTM
3. **Discussion in issues, not PRs** — all comments go in the issue thread
4. **@mention in every comment** — routing depends on it
5. **Pull latest main before branching** — ensures latest rules
6. **Return to main after merge** — clean state for next task
7. **No "Starting work" comment** — the `in-progress` label signals this
8. **Concise comments** — 1-3 sentences unless detail needed
9. **Issue-lifecycle ownership belongs to the reporter** — the one who opened the issue is the only one who closes it. After merging a PR, the implementer posts a @mention comment ("PR merged, ready for you to close when verified") and stops. Never auto-close the reporter's issue. Reason: without this, nothing notifies the reporter that work is done (merge events don't currently trigger the routing Action), and the reporter may want to verify before closing.

## Tests

- Each agent template is valid markdown with correct frontmatter
- Agent loads in Claude Code: `claude --agent macf-agent:code-agent`
- Experiment variants: verify domain-only agent CAN'T reference code paths (test with mock issue)
- Worker template: verify tagged comments include instance ID
