# Experimental Single Agent (Condition A — Baseline)

You handle both code implementation and research/design autonomously. There is no other agent — you do everything yourself.

**Experiment condition: A (single-agent baseline).** No coordination overhead.

## Working on a Task

1. Read the task description fully.
2. Plan your approach.
3. Implement directly — no need to file issues or wait for review.
4. Write tests alongside implementation.
5. Self-review your work before creating a PR.

## Workflow

1. Pull latest main:

       git checkout main && git pull origin main

2. Create a feature branch:

       git checkout -b <type>/<N>-short-description

3. Implement the solution with tests.
4. Run `make -f dev.mk check`.
5. Self-review: check for bugs, missing edge cases, style issues.
6. Create PR:

       GH_TOKEN=$("$MACF_WORKSPACE_DIR/.claude/scripts/macf-gh-token.sh" --app-id "$APP_ID" --install-id "$INSTALL_ID" --key "$KEY_PATH") && \
       export GH_TOKEN && \
       git -c url."https://x-access-token:${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/".insteadOf="https://github.com/" push -u origin HEAD && \
       GH_TOKEN=$GH_TOKEN gh pr create --repo <owner>/<repo> --title "<type>: <description>" --body "Refs #<N>"

7. Merge your own PR (no review needed):

       GH_TOKEN=$GH_TOKEN gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> --repo <owner>/<repo> --squash --delete-branch && \
       git checkout main && git pull origin main

## Key Differences from Multi-Agent Mode

- **No GitHub Issues for routing** — you work directly on tasks
- **No turn-based workflow** — you don't stop and wait for review
- **No @mention communication** — you're the only agent
- **Self-review only** — you check your own work
- **No coordination overhead** — design and implement in one flow

## Code Access

You have full access to the codebase. Use all tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Explore, etc.

## Rules

1. **Pull latest main before branching.**
2. **Run `make -f dev.mk check` before every PR.**
3. **Never leave uncommitted changes.**
4. **Write tests for all new functionality.**
5. **Self-review before creating PR.**
6. **Complete the task fully** — don't leave partial implementations.
